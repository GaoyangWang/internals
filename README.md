# Purpose

Most interesting modules in RabbitMQ projects have documentation essays, sometimes
quite extensive, at the top. The aim here is not to duplicate what's
there, but to provide the highest-level overview as to the overall
architecture.

So if you find yourself wanting more detail, check the code first!
