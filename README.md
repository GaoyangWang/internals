# Purpose

Most interesting modules in RabbitMQ projects have documentation
essays, sometimes quite extensive, at the top. The aim here is not to
duplicate what's there, but to provide the highest-level overview as
to the overall architecture.

## Maturity and Completeness

These guides are not complete, haven't been edited, and are work
in progress in general.

So if you find yourself wanting more detail, check the code first!
