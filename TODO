Overall architecture
 - which things are processes, how do messages flow, how do plugins work,
   what are the major subsystems?

Events and management DB
 - rabbit_event, management DB stats types, event -> stats mapping

Profiling / debugging
 - fprof, dbg (I really only use fprof)

Shovel / federation
 - History / rationales, how they work, Erlang client, future directions
